- This application was developed for the CEN4020 (Software Engineering) course during the summer 2023 semester. The development process involved assigned agile software development teams.
- The project was divided into 5 epics, and the stories were posted on our team's Jira board. 
- The roles of each team member rotated weekly, ensuring that all members had the opportunity to fulfill each role and promote versatility. 
	The roles included: Scrum Master, Developer#1, Developer#2, Tester#1, and Tester#2.
- We utilized a SQLite3 database, and the programming language of choice for development was Python, which facilitated easier testing (using pytest).
- We did a team presentation to the class about our finalized code, and how the components from each of the 5 epics all played a role in the finalized application.
